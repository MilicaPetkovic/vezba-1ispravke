    <h1>1984</h1>
    <h3>By<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell" target="_blank"> George Orwell</h3> </a>
    <h2>Part one</h2>
    <h2><em>Chapter 1</em></h2>

             <p>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking
             thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his
             breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly
             through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not
             quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering
             along with him.<br>
             The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At
             one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display,
             had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous
             face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of
             about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly
             handsome features. Winston made for the stairs.</p> 
             <p>It was
             no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom
             working, and at present the electric current was cut
             off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive
             in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up,
             and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer
             above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on
             the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster
             with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of
             those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow
             you about when you move.<br> <strong>BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING
             YOU</strong>, the caption beneath it ran.</p>
    <img src="1984.jpg" alt="knjiga">
              <p>The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had
             become an actual sheep’s bleat, and for an instant the face
             changed into that of a sheep. Then the sheep-face melted into
             the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing,
             huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seeming
             to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some
             of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards
             in their seats.</p>

             <p> But in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh
             of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the
             face of Big Brother, black-haired, black-moustachio’d, full
             of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost
             filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was
             saying. It was merely a few words of encouragement, the
             sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable
             individually but restoring confidence by the fact
             of being spoken. Then the face of Big Brother faded away
             again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals:<br><br>
    <p id="brod">
    <strong>WAR IS PEACE</strong><br>
    <strong>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY</strong><br>
    <strong>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</strong></p>
    </p>
